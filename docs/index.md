## Brief Overview of Pangenome Graphs

A pangenome graph is a graphical representation of the collective genomic information of a set of related organisms. Unlike a traditional linear genome assembly, which represents a single consensus genome sequence, a pangenome graph captures the genetic variation and structural diversity within a population. Pangenome graphs are constructed by integrating multiple genome sequences into a single graph structure that represents the entire set of genetic elements present in the population. This graph structure allows for the identification and visualization of genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations, as well as the relationships between different genomic regions. Pangenome graphs have become an important tool in genomics research, especially in the study of bacterial and viral populations, where genetic diversity is often high.
